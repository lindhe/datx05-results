# Results

This repository holds the results of every experiment we ran in the master's
thesis project
''Self-Stabilizing Services for Emulating Distributed Shared Memory on Message Passing Platforms''

## Dependencies

* `gnuplot`
* `bash`
* `python3.6`

## Structure

* `png/` holds all graphs generated by Gnuplot
* `result_logs/` holds all logs from experiment runs

* `*.gnu` are Gnuplot scripts which generates graphs for the corresponding csv files
* `*.csv` holds the summarised results

* `super_summary.sh` is used to compile logs into csv files
* `all_graphs.sh` runs all Gnuplot scripts. Remember to add any new scripts here too!

## Workflow

1. Run experiment
2. Save the logs into `result_logs/`
3. Generate `*_summary.txt` files (`reader_summary.txt` and
   `writer_summary.txt`, for example) using the `summary.py` and
   `filesize_summary.py` files from the
   [code repository](https://bitbucket.org/selfStabilizingAtomicStorage/datx05-code/).
4. Create CSV files using `super_summary.sh`, giving a path to an experiment log
   directory (e.g., `result_logs/test-servers/`) and operation identifier (`s`
   for server scalability, `r` for reader scalability and `w` for writer
   scalability).
5. Create graphs using the Gnuplot scripts: `./servers.gnu`
